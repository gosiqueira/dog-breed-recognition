# Dog Breed Recognition

## Description

Develop a simple dog breed recognition system. However, with an extra difficulty: adding races that weren't seen in training time, and knowing how to identify unknowns (for example, our dear mutts).

## Requirements

To proper run this repo you need to have installed the following packages:
- Python 3.6 or superior
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- TensorFlow 2.0

## Contributions

I'm always opened to discussions and contributions. So, if you find interesting what I developed here and have any suggestion to enhance the codes, please, let me now in the [issues](https://github.com/gosiqueira/dog-breed-recognition/issues).
